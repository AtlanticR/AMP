# Script to read in FlowCam data
# This script will read the percent of sample analyzed by the FlowCam
# I combined each "Zooplankton Samples xlsx" into one spreadsheet, where each
# sheet represents a different dataset (e.g., Gulf 2020, Gulf 2021, etc.)
# This was to clean up various formatting issues in Excel (a time saver)
# These were found in each directory, but combined into one to make reading in 
# the files a bit easier
# Took the first table from the "Samples" sheet in each spreadsheet
# The columns we want are:
# FlowCam Sample Name (to match with the data files)
# % of Sample Cleaned: Percentage of the sample that has been cleaned. This does not include 5mm portions of the sample. Cleaning refers to the sorting of images into the following classes: Zooplankton, 0-250Î¼m Length, Cut Images, Debris, Fragments of Zooplankton, Benthic, Clumped Zooplankton, Debris or Zooplankton, Bubbles.
# % of (post cleaned) Zooplankton Identified: The percentage of zooplankton from the Post Cleaning Zooplankton Count that have been identified. This does not include 5mm portions of the sample.
