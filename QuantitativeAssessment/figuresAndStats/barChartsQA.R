##### Bar chart figures

# Create the code for different bar charts of FlowCam (FC) /microscopy 
# (QA = quantitative assessment) comparisons

# The first ones are comparisons of every sample between the FC/QA data
# Shows relative abundance and stacked bar charts with breakdown of plankton within each sample

# Next ones show side by side bar charts of each taxa (as average relative abundance), 
# and how those differ between regions.
